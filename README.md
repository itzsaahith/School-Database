# School-Database
A project for me to learn Java


## Purpose
I stareted this project to learn more about OOP and database structure. It is "supposed" to be an application that can be used to keep track of all the students in a school.It keeps track of a student's name and their id (obviously, there would be much more functionality in such an application that would be used in the real world). Over time, I hope to add more changes as I learn more.

This repository is also my first time actually doing something with GitHub and Git in general.


## Progress
Currently, I have two main files in the repository (excluding the student class). Both these files accomplish the same goal but serialize and desirialize the information using different languages (XML, and JSON). I also made a program which acheives the same functionality by interacting with a MySQL database.
