# School-Database
A project for me to learn Java

I stareted this project to learn more about OOP and database structure. It is "supposed" to be an application that can be used to keep track of all the students in a school.It keeps track of a student's name and their id. It probably wouldn't be that useful in the real world ;). Over time, I hope to add more changes as I learn more.
