# School-Database
A project for me to learn Java

I stareted this project to learn more about OOP and database structure. It is "supposed" to be an application that can be used to keep track of all the students in a school.It keeps track of a student's name and their id. It probably wouldn't be that useful in the real world ;). Over time, I hope to add more changes as I learn more.


Currently, I have two main files in the repository (excluding the student class). Both these files accomplish the same goal but serialize and desirialize the information using different languages (XML, and JSON). I hope to make the program interact with a SQL database soon.
