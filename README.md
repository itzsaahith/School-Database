# School-Database
A project for me to learn Java


## Purpose
I stareted this project to learn more about OOP and database structure. It is an application that can track all the students in a school. It keeps track of a student's name and their corresponding student id. Over time, I hope to add more changes as I learn more.

## Progress
Currently, I have two main files in the repository (excluding the student class). Both these files accomplish the same goal but serialize and desirialize the information using different languages (XML, and JSON). I also made a program which acheives the same functionality by interacting with a MySQL database.
